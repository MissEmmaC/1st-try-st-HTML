            I will be doing a course but for now <br> I have been watching video's on YouTube, and using Apps to teach myself.</h4>

        <p>I am using different commands here to practice and to show what I can do!!</p><br>
        I want to <em> change </em> my carrer and computers is something <br> I've always been interested in.
         <br> Ive tried differnet things over the last year or so and other courses <br> But there just not for <strong> me!! </strong>
         <p> I thought about it over the Christmas break and what I enjoy doing and that happens to be anything to do with <strong> computers!! </strong> </p>
       <p> One thing that made me have such an interest in computers was my <strong> LOVE </strong> for <em> The Sims. </em> 
        <br> Litereally one of the BEST games ever, and thats what got me interested in downloading, unzipping files, etc. 
        <p> I am going to share a link now to The Sims Official website so you can see how great it is! <pr>
